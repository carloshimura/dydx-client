## 3.4.0

- Migrated to conan 2.0
- Removed versioned library directory, now it's installing directly to `libdir`
- Removed deprecated `set_[min|max]_fractions` methods from `decimal_formatter`
- A few optimizations
- Fixed windows DLL building

## 3.3.0

- Added `take_range_n` with arguments (`from`, `length`)

## 3.2.4

- Fixed `basic_data.push_back(basic_data<T>&&)` behaviour, as it hadn't actually pushed data except first element
- Renamed `version` file to `version.info` as it have been conflicting with some windows headers

## 3.2.3

- Added calculating real precision for decimal_formatter to format more accurate result
- Marked as deprecated methods `set_[min|max]_fractions`, use instead `set_[min|max]_precision` in `decimal_formatter`
- TODO: add rounding modes to `decimal_formatter`

## 3.2.2

- Fixed conanfile package_info

## 3.2.1

- Cmake-style install targets, now supports `find_package(Toolbox)`,
  linking: `target_link_libraries(my_lib toolbox::toolbox)`

## 3.2.0

- Now boost is required always if cmake can't find `<regex>`

## 3.1.3
- Added support for compiling on gcc 4.8.5
- Disabled helper bytes literal operators for gcc < 5 (didn't tested on other compilers)
- Using boost if cmake can't find <regex> in include path (on test machines it's gcc < 6)
- Added strings methods for replacing string vector with just one string (old substr_replace_all supports it too, but second argument should be a vector with 1 element):
    - `void substr_replace_all(const std::vector<std::string>, const std::string&, std::string&)`
    - `std::string substr_replace_all_ret(const std::vector<std::string>, const std::string&, const std::string&)`

## 3.1.2
- Added support for compiling on gcc 4.9
- Added strings `trim` and `trim_ref` methods to remove characters "\t\n\r\x0B"
- Added generating pc.in file
